    abstract = {We present GIGA-Lens: a gradient-informed, GPU-accelerated Bayesian framework for modeling strong gravitational lensing systems, implemented in TensorFlow and JAX. The three components, optimization using multi-start gradient descent, posterior covariance estimation with variational inference, and sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, all take advantage of gradient information through automatic differentiation and massive parallelization on graphics processing units (GPUs). We test our pipeline on a large set of simulated systems and demonstrate in detail its high level of performance. The average time to model a single system on four Nvidia A100 GPUs is 105 seconds. The robustness, speed, and scalability offered by this framework make it possible to model the large number of strong lenses found in current surveys and present a very promising prospect for the modeling of O(10^5) lensing systems expected to be discovered in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.},

    abstract = {Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for practical applications like chemistry and materials science on near-term quantum computers as they typically reduce quantum resource requirements. However, in order to implement VQAs, an efficient classical optimization strategy is required. Here we present a new stochastic gradient descent method using an adaptive number of shots at each step, called the global Coupled Adaptive Number of Shots (gCANS) method, which improves on prior art in both the number of iterations as well as the number of shots required. These improvements reduce both the time and money required to run VQAs on current cloud platforms. We analytically prove that in a convex setting gCANS achieves geometric convergence to the optimum. Further, we numerically investigate the performance of gCANS on some chemical configuration problems. We also consider finding the ground state for an Ising model with different numbers of spins to examine the scaling of the method. We find that for these problems, gCANS compares favorably to all of the other optimizers we consider.},

We use deep residual neural networks, building on previous work presented by Huang et al. These surveys together cover approximately one-third of the sky visible from the Northern Hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of âˆ¼22.5. We compile a training sample that consists of known lensing systems as well as non-lenses in the Legacy Surveys and the Dark Energy Survey. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. Here we present 1210 new strong lens candidates.},

    abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present an algorithm for the automatic labelling of monolayer graphene from a single RGB image taken from a standard microscope. We are thus faced with the challenge of analyzing a noisy low contrast image with significant visual artifacts. The methods described attempt to compensate for these imperfections in the data with minimal ad-hoc information, allowing them to generalize quite naturally to a wide array of applications. Chief among these methods are the image segmentation method, and a novel artifact removal method.},

    abstract = {{The APS-Upgrade presents several challenging demands to the booster synchrotron. Swap-out injection requires the booster to capture a high charge bunch (up to 17 nC), accelerate it to 6 GeV, and maintain a low emittance at extraction for injection into the storage ring. To accommodate these conflicting demands, the RF frequency will be ramped between injection and extraction. However, the RF cavity tuners will remain static, which means the couplers will need to withstand a high reflected power at extraction. This paper presents a plan for a system that will meet the requirements for injection efficiency, extracted emittance, and equivalent power at the coupler. Results from tracking simulations and beam studies with a frequency ramp will also be shown.}},
